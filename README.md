# CreatorOS

CreatorOS is an AI-powered creator analytics platform that helps content creators evaluate and improve short-form videos before publishing. Users can upload a video, automatically generate a transcript, and receive AI-driven feedback on content quality, audience targeting, hook effectiveness, retention potential, and overall viral potential.

The goal of CreatorOS is to act as an intelligent content coach, helping creators optimize videos through actionable recommendations rather than relying solely on trial and error.

## Motivation

Many creators struggle to understand why certain videos perform well while others fail to gain traction. CreatorOS aims to bridge that gap by providing creators with actionable, AI-generated feedback before publishing content.

Rather than attempting to guarantee virality, CreatorOS focuses on identifying strengths, weaknesses, and optimization opportunities that can improve audience engagement and retention.
